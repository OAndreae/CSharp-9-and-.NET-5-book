# Exercise 1.1 - Test your knowledge
- 1 A programmer can use different languages to write applications that run on .NET because all of the languages are compiled to the same Intermediate Language (IL) code. When the program is run, CoreCLR (Core Common Language Runtime, a virtual machine installed on the operating system) loads the IL code from the assembly and the just-in-time (JIT) compiler compiles it to native CPU instructions. These are then executed.
- 2 To create a new command line application, type `dotnet new console`
- 3 To build and run a program at the command prompt, type `dotnet run`
- 4 The VS Code shortcut to view the terminal is Ctrl + '
- 5 Visual Studio 2019 is better than VS Code for more advanced debugging and development
- 6 .NET Core is better than .NET Framework as it is cross-platform, modular, and will receive new features.
- 7 .NET Standard is a specification for all the APIs that are implemented in that level of compatibility. It is important as there are currently different implementations of the Base Class Library depending on the platform being targeted.
- 8 The entry point of a .NET console application is the Main method. It is declared as `static void Main(string][] args)`
- 9 C# keywords are available in the C# documentation.
- 10 Solutions to common programming problems can be found on Scott Hanselman's website and StackOverflow.
